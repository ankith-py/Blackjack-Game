# Blackjack Game
Simple Blackjack game developed as a midterm project for COP2800 -- Programming with Java -- at the University of Florida. Please note that the 'P1Random.java' file was given to us by the professor to ensure that 'Blackjack.java' is graded accordingly given different cases. Refer to the 'P1-SampleOutput.txt' and 'P1-RandomNumber.txt' to view expected inputs and outputs.
