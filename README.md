# Blackjack-Game
Simple Blackjack game developed as a midterm project for 'Programming with Java' course at the University of Florida. Please note that the 'P1Random.java' file was given to us by the professor
to ensure that 'Blackjack.java' is graded accordingly given different cases. Refer to the 'P1-SampleOutput.txt' and 'P1-RandomNumber.txt' to view expected inputs and outputs.
